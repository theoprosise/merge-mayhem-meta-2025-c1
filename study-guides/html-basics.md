# HTML Basics

## What is HTML?

**HTML** stands for **H**yper **T**ext **M**arkup **L**anguage. HTML is used to build the skeleton of the website including which elements (text, images, buttons, etc.) should be included and the order in which they appear. Web browsers like Chrome or Safari know how to interpret HTML files and render their contents as an interactive web page.
HTML files typically contain things like:

- the text contents of a web page, structured into a hierarchy of page elements
- hyperlinks to other pages
- references to other files like images, CSS files, and JavaScript files
- definitions for interactive controls like buttons and text fields
- metadata to help web browsers understand the contents of the page
**Let’s take a look at a typical boilerplate, or standard template, for an HTML file.**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
 <head>
   <meta charset="utf-8">
   <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width">
   <title>Title of Website</title>
   <link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
 </head>
 <body>
   <script src="script.js"></script>
 </body>
</html>
```

In HTML, we denote an element by specifying the name of the element in opening brackets `<>` and closing brackets `</>`. Let’s take the time to highlight the structure of an HTML file and some important elements presented in the boilerplate above.
