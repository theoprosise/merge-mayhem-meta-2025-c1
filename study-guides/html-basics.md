# HTML Basics
HTML files typically contain things like:

- the text contents of a web page, structured into a hierarchy of page elements
- hyperlinks to other pages
- references to other files like images, CSS files, and JavaScript files
- definitions for interactive controls like buttons and text fields
- metadata to help web browsers understand the contents of the page
